## Moblie technology used: Xamarin
I used Visual Studio 2022 to develop the app

To use the app on Windows/Mac, Xamarin.Forms needs to be installed through Visual Studio.  
The installation guide from Microsoft can be found here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/get-started/installation/?pivots=macos-vs2022

Once installed, clone the repo, and begin running.
